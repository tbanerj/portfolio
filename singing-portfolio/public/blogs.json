    "excerpt": "PitchPanel began with a conversation, not a business plan. When a close friend told me she wanted to learn how to sing but couldn’t afford lessons, it forced me to confront how often access, not talent, limits creative growth. Combining my background in computer science and music, I set out to build a tool that supports singers who lack resources while respecting the role of trained voice teachers. After a year of building audio analysis models, struggling through deployment, and learning how fragile real-world systems can be, PitchPanel is now live. It’s still evolving, but it represents my belief that meaningful feedback should not be reserved only for those who can pay for it.",
    "content": "PitchPanel started as a conversation. A close friend once told me she wanted to learn how to sing but couldn’t afford voice lessons. That moment stuck with me. Talent and passion are everywhere, but access rarely is. I kept asking why something as personal and fundamental as learning to sing depended so heavily on expensive instruction. That question became PitchPanel. My goal was never to replace voice teachers. Great teachers are irreplaceable. PitchPanel is meant to support singers who lack access to instruction and to supplement guided training, not compete with it. Many music apps try to gamify singing, but singing is not one skill. It’s the coordination of pitch accuracy, breath support, and diction clarity. I wanted to build a tool that focused on those core elements instead of surface-level feedback. Over the past year, I developed Python algorithms to analyze pitch accuracy using reference notes, detect breath support through RMS energy dropouts, and measure diction clarity using spectral centroid averages. I combined these features using a linear regression model to generate interpretable feedback for singers. Getting this to work was slow and messy. Real voices are inconsistent, audio data is noisy, and models fail in ways you don’t expect. As PitchPanel grew from a small prototype into a functional app, I focused on core functionality over polish. At the same time, I faced one of the hardest parts of the process: hosting. I had to learn how to deploy a backend, configure servers, manage SSL certificates, open ports, and debug systems that worked locally but broke in production. It taught me that software doesn’t matter unless it runs reliably in the real world. PitchPanel is now live at pitchpanel.org and available on the Apple App Store. It’s still evolving, but it represents months of iteration, failure, and learning. More than anything, it’s my attempt to make high-quality vocal feedback more accessible, especially for singers who would otherwise go without it."

    "excerpt": "Performance nerves never really disappear. But learning to work with them instead of fighting them can unlock something raw and authentic.",
    "content": "A lot of people assume that if you perform enough, the nerves eventually go away. I used to believe that too. But now I think nerves are part of the deal. They just change shape.\n\nIn the beginning, I tried to fight the fear. I’d tense up, overthink everything, and hope no one noticed. But all that pressure made it harder to breathe, harder to connect.\n\nOver time, I’ve started seeing nerves as energy. Not something to avoid but something to guide. I stretch, I breathe slowly, and I remind myself that performance isn't about being in control. It's about letting go.\n\nWhen I stop trying to force confidence, I find something much more real. The shaking voice, the fast heartbeat, even the sweat—it all means I care. And if I let that energy move through me instead of trying to block it, the performance becomes honest.\n\nNow, when I step onto a stage, I don't aim to feel fearless. I aim to feel ready enough to trust the moment."

    "excerpt": "Performance is more than precision. It’s about emotional honesty. This post explores the intersection between technical mastery and vulnerability on stage.",
    "content": "For a long time, I thought singing was all about technique. I used to focus on posture, breath control, and clarity. I believed that if I perfected all the moving parts, everything else would follow.\n\nBut I realized that the most powerful moments happen when you forget the rules. When your body knows the technique so well that your mind is free to feel. That’s when the performance becomes more than just correct.\n\nEmotion doesn't always look dramatic. Sometimes it's as simple as a breath that lingers or a pause that lets a phrase land. When it's real, it resonates.\n\nTechnique still matters. It gives structure and reliability. But the heart of any performance lives in what you feel. I try to show up not just as a voice but as a whole person. That’s what makes the experience feel human on both sides."

    "excerpt": "Before any sound, there’s stillness. This post reflects on how the quiet just before performance reveals more about artistry than any note ever could.",
    "content": "There’s a quiet that wraps itself around the start of every performance. It's not just the hush of an audience or the pause before a cue. It's something deeper, a stillness that feels like both an ending and a beginning.\n\nIn those seconds, I feel time slow. My thoughts blur, my body steadies, and something inside me listens. Not to the crowd or any outside noise, but to myself. It's in that silence that I remember why I perform.\n\nThere’s no showing off in that moment. Just breath, memory, and a sense of presence. I've learned to respect this part. To pause and sit in it fully. Because once the first phrase begins, things start moving fast.\n\nThat silence before anything happens is where I find the thread that ties it all together. It reminds me that performance isn’t only about sound. It’s about intention, and the quiet place where it begins."
